Asteroids

List of user functionality:
- Move player one with W,S,A,D. Fire a bullet with SPACE.
-Move player two with the ARROW KEYS, Fire bullets with M

Reasoning behind design choices:
I think asteroids is boring, so I made it competetive and two player to make it fun.
The controls and movement were tweaked until they felt right. I made the movement fast and deceleration fast for tighter controls.
All art assets were drawn by me for other games.

Brief description of above and beyond features:
I added scoring for both users, multiple menus, and custom graphics. And two players so that counts for something.

Requirements not completed: None.
